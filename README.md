### Mechanical Chisel

The mechanical chisel is a kinetic block similar to Create's mechanical saw. If a block is part of a chiseling recipe, the mechanical chisel will convert it to another block in the same recipe. The mechanical chisel also has a filter to specify a specific block in the recipe as output.
